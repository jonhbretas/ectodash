# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-08-02)

**Core value:** Coordenador consegue ver, num só lugar, o andamento real de todas as demandas/projetos da instituição — quem é responsável, qual o prazo, o que está atrasado — sem precisar cobrar manualmente ou vasculhar planilhas e grupos.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — Project Scaffold & Institutional Login

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (Project Scaffold & Institutional Login) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 4
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-08-03 — Phase 01 execution started

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 25%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Auth+RLS foundation split into 3 phases (login, roles/RLS, accessible UI) so each ships an independently observable capability before Demandas work begins.
- Roadmap: Reminders, AI pipeline, and Finance dashboard/sync are mutually independent after Phase 4 — can be resequenced or parallelized by coordinator urgency.
- Roadmap: AI human-review gate (Phase 8) is a hard requirement, never bypassed — no demanda is auto-created from AI extraction.
- Roadmap revision (2026-08-03): System no longer generates its own meeting summary — Fireflies/tl;dv already produce it (IA-02 removed, moved to Out of Scope; IA-01 reworded to "paste ready-made summary"). Old Phase 8 (AI Meeting Summary) merged into old Phase 9, forming the new Phase 8 (AI Task Extraction & Review: paste summary + extract suggested demandas + human review gate). All phases from old 9-11 renumbered down to 8-10. Total phase count: 11 → 10.
- [Phase ?]: Kept typescript pinned at researched latest (7.0.2) rather than downgrading to satisfy lagging tooling; hand-assembled eslint.config.mjs from underlying plugins since eslint-config-next cannot load under TS 7.x (typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint#10940); enabled next.config.ts experimental.useTypeScriptCli for the same reason
- [Phase ?]: Tightened .gitignore from create-next-app default .env* to .env*.local so the tracked .env.local.example template is not itself gitignored

### Pending Todos

[From .planning/todos/pending/ — ideas captured during sessions]

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

[Issues that affect future work]

- Research flag: Phase 8 (AI extraction) needs prompt/schema design work for relative-date resolution — plan with extra care.
- Research flag: Phase 9 (Sheets sync) — actual spreadsheet layout unknown until inspected; start planning with a discovery step against the live sheet.
- Research flag: re-verify current Supabase pause window, Vercel cron cap, and Resend quota numbers at Phase 1/7 start (free-tier limits drift over time).
